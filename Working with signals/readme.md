# Working with signals 
In this project, we develop a simple feedforward (MLP) neural network. Then we work on understanding the basics of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by performing convolution and correlations on signals.
In addition to this, we design and plot the frequency response for a few ARMA filters.
