# Character recognition using a trained MLP; LMS algorithm for channel modeling/tracking
In this project, we develop the feedforward processing for a multilayerperceptron (MLP) deep neural network. We then perform Character recognition using the trained MLP.
In addition to this, we implement an LMS algorithm for channel modeling/tracking.
