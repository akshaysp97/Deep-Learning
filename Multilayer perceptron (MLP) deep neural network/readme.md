# Multilayer perceptron (MLP) deep neural network
In this project, we train an MLP to classify MNIST, then proceed to train an MLP using various constraints. The second part of the project deals with training an MLP on Binary data pertaining to the category Human/Machine. The specific tasks to be performed are described in the problem statement.
